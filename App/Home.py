Hi there! :wave:
Welcome to Neuro Synk – your neurodivergent ally. I’m here to support you in many ways, including:
- Judging tones in written texts 
- Translating messages into different tones (e.g., professional, sarcastic, funny)
- Identifying and explaining ambiguity in communication
- Creating social stories to help reduce anxiety in social situations

I understand how overwhelming things can be, so feel free to reach out whenever you need help navigating communication challenges. Whether you need feedback, clarity, or just a safe space to express yourself, I’ve got your back.

Please go to the left sidebar and select the page you would like to visit. Let's synk up! :sparkles:
