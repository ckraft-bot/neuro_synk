When I was nine years old I went off to summer camp for the first time. And my mother packed me a suitcase full of books, which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do. Because in my family, reading was the primary group activity. And this might sound antisocial to you, but for us it was really just a different way of being social.

You have the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you, but you are also free to go roaming around the adventure land inside your own mind. And I had this idea that camp was going to be just like this, but better. I had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns.

Modern software development often involves complex systems that need to adapt quickly to changes, whether it's user requirements, technology updates, or market shifts. Clean Architecture can help with this. It is a software design philosophy that emphasizes creating systems that are easy to understand, maintain, and extend. 

At its core, Clean Architecture tries to ensure that the most important parts of your application, like business rules and logic, are independent of external concerns such as frameworks, databases, or user interfaces. 

In simple terms, Clean Architecture organizes a software system into layers, each with a specific responsibility. Dependencies flow only in one direction: toward the core business logic. This structure helps keep the system modular, testable, and resilient to changes.
